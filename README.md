# ![icon] Red Panda Launcher

Advanced search functions on a new home screen for Firefox.

## Features

### Tab to search

Press TAB after a few characters to search in the matching site if it has an OpenSearch provider defined.

### TLD matching
Recognize urls by .tld, so search terms containing '.' won't try to open a webpage.

### Search transformations
Add extra search options for specific terms, like excluding a domain. 

### Start page

Access recently closed tabs on the new tab page.
